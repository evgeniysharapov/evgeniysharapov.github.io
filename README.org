* About 

  Personal web-site made as a static web-site generated using =org-mode=

* Building 

  First make sure that you generated CSS out of SASS

  #+begin_src shell
    sass assets/css/styles.scss assets/css/styles.css
  #+end_src

  To build just run =make=


  When doing development it's helpful to run a =watch= command

  #+begin_src shell
    watch -n 1 sass assets/css/styles.scss assets/css/styles.css && rm -rf ~/.org-timestamps && make
  #+end_src
  

* Running Locally

  To run it locally you could use any simple HTTP server that would serve static content

  #+begin_src shell
    python -m http.server 8000 --directory public
  #+end_src

  This will kick off web-server on port 8000


* Deployment
